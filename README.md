## About me
My name is **Hanlin Cai (Lance)**. I am a junior majoring in Automation at [Fuzhou University] (China) and Robotics and Intelligent Devices at [Maynooth University] (Ireland, Combined Degrees). I gain a CGPA of **3.79/4.00**, ranking top 10% in my major. Recently, I am nominated for the 2021-2022 **China National Scholarship** (top 1%). üéä

[My personal Website] averages over 1000+ views a month. In addition, my [Zhihu] account has more than 1200+ followers and 10000+ likes, and my [Bilibili] account possesses around 2000 followers. Ultimately, if you are interested in my experience, here is [my resume (CV)]. üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

## My Research Interests
Currently, I am interested in **IoT (Internet of Things)** and **ML (Machine Learning)**. Also, the IEEE conference paper focusing on the real-time garbage monitoring base on IoT technology in 2022 [CENIM]  with the aid of my supervisor ([Chin-Hong Wong]) will be published in Dec, 2022. 

Besides, I am currently attending a summer research project organized by the University of Cambridge (CCISTC) under the guidance of [Prof. Pietro Lio'] and exploring an ML-based scheme for IoT cybersecurity. üöÄ

**My latest research paper can be fund here:**

1. [An IoT Garbage Monitoring System for Effective Garbage Management] which has been accpeted by  2022 [CENIM] IEEE conference.
