## (1) Requirements Analysis (Using NABCD Model)

### 1-1 Need / Background

The Mid-Autumn Festival is one of the traditional Chinese festivals, which symbolizes reunion and happiness. Bobing is a custom activity in southern Fujian. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, people get together with their relatives and friends to Bobing and enjoy the Mid-Autumn moon. 🎑

However, since the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, many people cannot gather together as before. In order to maintain the original holiday atmosphere, more and more people share the fun of Bobing through online Bobing application.

In the case, our Android Bobing App is coming! 💥

### 1-2 Approach

**We construct our Android App through the following technologies:**

1. Front-End: Android Navigation & okhttp & Javascript & Webview
2. Back-End & Server: Java & Javaweb & Spring Springmvc
3. Database: mysql & jdbctemplate

**The following flow-chart shows the process of our Bobing App:** 

1. The User strats the Bobing App;
2. User clicks to enter next page;
3. User fills in the infomation;
4. Game playing & Data Transfer to Server;
5. Server process the data;
6. Server transfer the data back to the Ranking List;
7. User stops the game (over).

**The benefits of online Bobing App are obvious:**

1. Online Bobing App break through the restriction that people cannot gather during the epidemic and enjoy the happiness brought by online Bobing App; 👪
2. Also, Bobing App can continue to pass on the traditional Chinese customs, which can prevent that children do not know the traditional custom of Mid-Autumn Festival due to the COVID-19 restriction; 🎑
3. Our online Bobing offer users a relaxed gaming experience, refresh their mood after heavy school work. 🏫

### 1-4 Competition

1. As a non-profit Android game App, there will be no advertising placement, which may causes an upset gaming experience. 👏
2. Compared to the existing applets, our UI design are much cleaner and more user-friendly. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
3. Lower post-operation and maintenance costs. 💰

### 1-5 Delivery

All of our work will be open-source and available in [our Github Repo](https://github.com/GuangLun2000/awesome-EE308FZ-software-engineering).

And our App can  run efficiently and safely on Android system.
