## 2 Start Action

### **2.1 Project Introduction (项目介绍)**

Our project aims to establish an **intelligent IoT garbage management system** for urban communities——**Garbage Manager**.

本项目致力于建立一个能与「智慧城市的可持续发展」、「市政垃圾的处理需求」有机结合的新型智能IoT垃圾监管系统——**垃圾管理卫士**。

### 2.2 Individual Contribution Points

Our individual contribution points are judged by **the degree of completion of each person's assigned task**. Each person's assigned task is determined by the team leader according to each person's own level, and the percentage of the task in the project is determined by the team leader and team members after discussion. 

After that, if the member **does not complete the task**, the performance evaluation is made by the completed degree, based on **the original task share of 90%**, and if the member **completes the task**, the performance evaluation of the original task share is obtained. If the member **over-completes the task**, the performance evaluation is made on the basis of **the original task share of 110%**. Finally, the percentage is adjusted to ensure that **ΣContribution ratio of each person=total number of people × 100%.**

### 2.3 Contribution Proportion

*It is forbidden to make the same score. If there is no evaluation, the team leader's score will be reduced by 50% after the average of the whole group.*

### 3.4 Experience

#### 3.4.1 Selection of UML design tools, reasons for selection and evaluation of tools after use.

The UML tool chosen by our group is **[ProcessOn](https://www.processon.com/)**

The main reason for choosing it is that it is free and has some UML diagram templates that are easier for first time users to get started as well as convenient. And many people think it has a simple interface, convenient functions, easy to operate, and can also invite collaboration, which facilitates communication and exchange between teams.

#### 3.4.2 Difficulties encountered in this task and solutions

##### Difficulties encountered:

1. We didn't know much about UML diagrams before, and we rarely tried to document the process without being required to do so.
2. Most of us have no team development experience and have not used teamwork tools, such as Shimo Document, Github Teams.

##### Relevant solution: 

1. After querying and learning various types of UML diagrams, the UML diagram is drawn.
2. We held two offline meetings to update our progress and we have opened the online channel for efficient team collaboration.
